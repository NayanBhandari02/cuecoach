ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION These regulations address dress requirements, protests, scheduling issues, and other items that are not part of the actual Rules of Play but need to be regulated for the individual event. Some aspects of applying the regulations vary from tournament to tournament, such as the number of Sets in a Match and who breaks after the first rack at 9-Ball. The management of an event is entitled to enforce regulations for the event. These Regulations do not have the same force as the Rules; the Rules have priority. 2. EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULES The actual Rules of Play may not be altered unless a specific waiver is issued by the WPA Sports Director or other WPA official for the individual event. A written explanation of any rules change should be made available at the players’ meeting. 3. DRESS CODE Each player’s attire must always meet the level of the competition and be clean, proper and in good condition. If an athlete is unsure about the legality of his attire, the athlete should approach the tournament director before the Match and ask whether the attire is legal. The tournament director has the final say with regards to the legality of attire. In exceptional circumstances, the director may permit a player to compete in violation of the dress code e.g. when airline lu"}

The following are the current requirements for World Championship and World Tour events. 3.1 MEN Men may wear either a long sleeve shirt and button-down vest or a regular collared shirt or polo shirt of any color. Shirt or polo shirt must be tucked in. It must be in a good condition and clean. No T-shirts are allowed. The shirt must have at least a short sleeve.

BALL RACK TEMPLATE The Ball Rack Template can be used for the Disciplines: 8-ball, 9-ball, 10-ball and Heyball. In 14/1 it´s not allowed to use the Ball Rack Template. 4.1 POSITIONING OF THE BALL RACK TEMPLATE The table must be marked before the tournament has started. A Vertical line must be drawn for the positioning of the Ball Rack Template. This line must be long enough to pass through the top and bottom holes on the Ball Rack Template. 4.2 REMOVING OF THE BALL RACK TEMPLATE After the break, the Ball Rack Template must be removed by the referee from the table as soon as possible without disturbing any of the balls.

With the removal of the Ball Rack Template, the referee or opponent may use markers in the form of ball markers or chalk blocks which are at their disposal to mark the obstructing balls. The Ball Rack Template must be placed in its required spot away from the playing area including the rails and the balls placed back into their original position."}

Template may not be glued on the playing surface. 5. PLAYING WITH AN “AREA” REFEREE It may be that a tournament is being played with “area” referees who are each responsible for several tables and there is no referee constantly at each table. In this case, the players are still expected to observe all the rules of the Discipline. The recommended way to conduct play in this situation is as follows. The non-shooting player will perform all of the duties of the referee. If, prior to a particular shot, the shooting player feels that his opponent will not be able to properly judge the shot, he should ask the area referee to watch the shot. The non-shooting player may also ask for such attention if he feels that he is unable or is unwilling to rule on the shot. Either player has the power to suspend play until he is satisfied with the way the Match is being refereed. If a dispute arises between two players in an unrefereed Match, and the area referee is asked to make a decision without having seen the cause of the dispute, he should be careful to understand the situation as completely as possible. This might include asking trusted w"}

This might include asking trusted witnesses, reviewing video tapes, or reenacting the shot. If the area referee is asked to determine whether a foul occurred and there is no evidence of the foul except the claim of one player while the other player claims that there was no foul, then it is assumed that no foul occurred. 6. PENALIZING UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT The rules and regulations give the referee and other officials considerable latitude in penalizing unsportsmanlike conduct. Several factors should be considered in such decisions, including previous conduct, previous warnings, how serious the offense is, and information that the players may have been given at the Players’ Meeting at the start of the tournament. In addition, the level of competition may be considered since players at the top levels can be expected to be fully familiar with the rules and regulations, while relative beginners may be unfamiliar with how the rules are normally applied. 7. PROTEST RULING If a player needs a decision to be taken, the first person to be contacted is the referee. The referee will form his decision by all means that seem suitable to him.

A deposit of $100 from the protestor is required for such an appeal and it will be forfeited in case of an adverse final decision. A player is allowed to ask for a reconsideration of a factual decision by the referee only one time. If he asks for reconsideration of the same matter a second time, it will be treated as unsportsmanlike conduct. 8. INSTRUCTIONS FOR REFEREES The referee will determine all matters of fact relating to the rules, maintain fair playing conditions, call fouls, and take other action as required by these rules. The referee will suspend play when conditions do not permit fair play. Play will also be suspended when a call or ruling is being disputed. The referee will announce fouls and other specific situations as required by the rules. He will answer questions as required by the rules on matters such as foul count. He must not give advice on the application of the rules, or other points of play on which he is not required by the rules to speak.

He may assist the player by getting and replacing the mechanical bridge. If necessary for the shot, the referee or a deputy may hold the light fixture out of the way. When a Discipline has a three-foul rule, the referee should note to the players any second foul at the time that it occurs and also when the player who is on two fouls returns to the table. The first warning is not required by the rules but is meant to prevent later misunderstandings. If there is a scoreboard on which the foul count is visible to the players, it satisfies the warning requirement. 9. REFEREE’S RESPONSIVENESS The referee shall answer players’ inquiries regarding objective data, such as whether a ball will be in the rack, whether a ball is above the Head String, what the count is, how many points are needed for a victory, if a player or his opponent is on a foul, what rule would apply if a certain shot is made, etc. When asked for a clarification of a rule, the referee will explain the applicable rule to the best of his ability, but any misstatement by the referee will not protect a player from enforcement of the actual rules.

Upon recognition by either player or the referee that the groups have been reversed, the rack will be halted and will be replayed with the original player executing the break shot. 11. RESTORING A POSITION In any case a position of balls needs to be amended it is solely the referee’s duty and responsibility to perform this task. He may form his opinion by any means he considers appropriate at the time. He may consult one or both players on that, however, the particular player’s opinion is not binding and his judgment can be amended. Each involved player has the right to dispute the referee’s judgment just once, but after that it is the referee’s discretion to restore the ball or balls. 12. ACCEPTANCE OF EQUIPMENT After the tournament or a particular Match has been started, the player has no right to question the quality or legality of any equipment provided by the Tournament Organizer unless supported by the referee or the tournament director; any protests must be made beforehand. 13.

Although the task of clearing pockets of balls lies within the referee’s description of duties, the ultimate responsibility for any occurrence of fouls as a result of such misadministration always rests with the shooter. If the referee is absent, for example in the case of an area referee, the shooter may perform this duty himself, providing he makes his intention clear and obvious to the opponent. 14. TIME OUT Unless specified otherwise by the tournament organizer, each player is allowed to take one time out of five minutes during Matches played over 9 (for 8-Ball and Heyball) and 13 (for 9-Ball and 10-Ball) racks. If Matches are shorter there is no time out. To exercise his right to a time out the player must: (1) inform the referee of his intention and, (2) make sure the referee is aware of the fact and marks it on the score sheet and, (3) make sure the referee marks the table for suspended play.

The time out in 8-ball, 9-ball, 10-ball and Heyball is taken between racks and play is suspended. At 14.1, the time out begins between racks; and the player at the table may continue his inning should the opponent decide to take his time out. If the non-shooter takes a time out, he must make sure there is a referee to supervise the table during his absence; otherwise he has no right to protest against any misplay by the player at the table. The player taking the time out should remember that his actions must be within the spirit of the sport and if he acts otherwise, he is subject to a penalty under the Unsportsmanlike Conduct. If a player is suffering from a medical condition, the tournament director may choose to adjust the number of time outs. 15. RACK AT 9-BALL As stated in Rule 6.2 9-Ball Rack, balls other than the one and nine are placed randomly in the rack and should not be set in any particular order during any rack.

Once warned, should the player continue with intentional positioning of balls in the rack, he shall be penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. 16. THE THREE-BALL BREAK RULE (1) On the break shot, a minimum of three object-balls must either be pocketed, or cross the Head String line, or a combination of both. For example, if one object- ball is pocketed, then at least two object-balls must cross the Head String line; or if two object-balls are pocketed, then at least one object-ball must cross the Head String line. To cross the Head String line means that the center (or resting point) of the object-ball must go beyond the line. (2) If a player fails to meet the requirements in (1), but otherwise makes a legal break, the incoming player has the choice to accept the tables as is, or hand the shot back to his opponent.

(5) If a player fails to meet the requirements of (1) but otherwise makes a legal break and pockets the 9-ball, the 9-ball is spotted before the next shot is played. The three-ball rule must be present on all WPA ranking 9-ball events, together with the use of table training (tapped balls) or a racking template. 17. DEFLECTING CUE-BALL ON OPENING BREAK It may be that the player miscues on a break shot and tries to prevent the cue-ball from following its normal path by deflecting it with his cue stick or by some other means. This practice and other similar practices are absolutely forbidden under the unsportsmanlike conduct rule, Rule 3.16(b). Players must never intentionally touch any ball in play except with a forward stroke of the cue tip on the cue-ball. The penalty for such a foul will be determined by the referee according to the unsportsmanlike conduct guidelines in Rule 3.16. 18.

The referee should ensure that interference is prevented, for example by a spectator or a player on an adjacent table and may suspend play as needed. Interference may be physical or verbal. 22. COACHING It is permitted for a player to receive advice from a coach during a Match. This should not be on a continuous shot-by-shot basis that changes the nature of the competition. It is up to the referee and tournament management to set additional limits on this. A time out can be used to get coaching help. The coach should not approach the table. If the referee decides that the coach is interfering with or disrupting the Match, he may direct the coach to stay away from the Match. 23. ACT OF GOD It may be that something unforeseen under these rules will occur during a Match. In such a case, the referee will decide how to proceed in a fair manner. For example, it may be necessary to move a rack in progress to a different table, in which case a st"}

REMAINING IN PLAYER’S CHAIR The non-shooting player should remain in his designated chair while his opponent is at the table. Should a player need to leave the playing area during Matches, he must request and receive permission from the referee. Should a player leave the playing area without the permission of the referee, it will be treated like unsportsmanlike conduct. 25. REFEREE UNCERTAINTY If the referee cannot determine whether a player fouled, the shot will be considered legal."}

CALLING FROZEN BALLS The referee should be careful to inspect and announce the status of any object-ball that might be frozen to a cushion and the cue-ball when it might be frozen to a ball. The seated player may remind the referee that such a call is necessary. The shooter must allow time for such a determination to be asked for and made and may ask for the call himself. 27. DOUBLES PLAY In doubles play, the players on each team alternate shots within a rack. The following rules apply. (1) The first time a team breaks, they will choose which player will break. (2) Breakers for each team will alternate regardless of which player on the team shot last. (3) The non-breaking team will announce their first shooter of each rack when it is time for them to shoot in that rack. (4) Any break shot, normal shot, or push out is counted as a turn at the table. Passing back the shot after a push out is not counted as a turn. Concerning a passed back push out, there are two approaches to decide who shoots next. The standard approach is \"push out for the partner,\" where the next shot after the push out is played by the partner. Alternatively, tournament officials may decide to use a \"push out for yourself\" approach, where the next shot after the push out is played by the same player who played the"}

Alternatively, tournament officials may decide to use a \"push out for yourself\" approach, where the next shot after the push out is played by the same player who played the push out. (5) Discussion among a team about shot selection and execution is not by itself a foul. (6) It is a foul to play out of order by mistake. It is unsportsmanlike conduct to play out of order on purpose. (7) If a team is uncertain of which player should shoot next, they may ask the opponents or officials for a determination, and the agreed-to answer is considered to be correct even if it is later found to be incorrect. (8) At 10-ball, if a shot is passed back after an uncalled ball is pocketed, the turn will pass to the other player on the team. The pass-back does not count as a turn by the other team. (9) For 14.1 Continuous, alternation of shots is strictly observed. Break shots at the start of a new rack are played by the next player in rotation and not by choice. On an opening break shot, a breaking violation is counted as a turn at the table even if a rebreak is asked for."}

RULES FOR RACKING If the players are racking for themselves, they can agree on whether to rack their own or rack for their opponent. If there is a disagreement, players will rack for their opponent and must rack to the best of their ability. Failure to rack to one's best ability for their opponent is considered unsportsmanlike conduct. Whenever a referee racks, the breaker is not allowed to inspect or touch the rack, and they must accept a legal rack without comment. Any violations of this are unsportsmanlike conduct. Protests may be lodged only against objectively incorrect racks, where ball placement violates the rules of the Discipline, or “Acts of God” that happen after the referee finished racking. 29. PLAYER ASSUMING REFEREE ROLE In Matches without a table referee, either player may suspend play if they feel an event official should be consulted. As long as both players agree, either player may temporarily assume the referee capacity for out-of-play activities such as racking, removing a template, cleaning balls, spotting balls, or moving balls in special racking situations. The mutual agreement must be ensured for each individual occurrence of such activity. When in a temporary referee capacity, the player must act to the best of their ability, and any accidental mistakes will"}

PARASPORT POOL 30.1 PLAYER’S ELIGIBILITY In addition to the official Pool Rules, athletes are bound by the current WPA Standard Terms and Conditions of Entry when they enter any international, regional, or national WPA competition. Athletes are also bound by “WPA Event Rules Adaptations,” published occasionally, which contain additional rules specific to Parasport tournaments. 30.2 ATHLETES’ ELIGIBILITY These Rules cater for athletes with musculoskeletal disorders, divided into two categories: (a) Wheelchair Athletes (Groups 1 to 5). (b) Standing Athletes with musculoskeletal disorders (Groups 6 to 10). The impairment must be permanent and apply to all categories 1 through 10. The functions mentioned in the criteria below must be certified by a medical professional, ensuring that rehabilitation cannot improve the impairment. 30.2.1 USE OF MEDICAL AIDS Special implants, bioprostheses, and technical aids to compensate for physical impairments affecting the athlete’s ability to move around the table and perform strokes are permitted, provided they do not conflict with WPA Regulations on using auxiliary equipment and devices. Aids that assist in aiming are prohibited. Referees can assist athletes with equipment setup but cannot assist with aiming or executing a stroke. 30.3 STANDARD FOUL"}

If an athlete requires assistance rolling around the table, another person may help them but must not touch the wheelchair during the actual shot. Violations of the above are considered to violate Rule 3.16 Unsportsmanlike Conduct, and will typically be penalized as follows: (a) 1st offense, cue-ball in hand for the opponent anywhere on the table; (b) 2nd offense, loss of the current game; and (c) 3rd offense, loss of the Match.
